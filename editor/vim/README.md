# VI & VIM Configuration

vi and vim settings and plugins

### Vundle

1. Introduction:

   Installation requires [Git] and triggers [`git clone`] for each configured repository to `~/.vim/bundle/` by default.
   Curl is required for search.

   If you are using Windows, go directly to [Windows setup]. If you run into any issues, please consult the [FAQ].
   See [Tips] for some advanced configurations.

   Using non-POSIX shells, such as the popular Fish shell, requires additional setup. Please check the [FAQ].

2. Set up [Vundle]:

   `$ git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`

3. Configure Plugins:

   Put this at the top of your `.vimrc` to use Vundle. Remove plugins you don't need, they are for illustration purposes.

   ```vim
   set nocompatible              " be iMproved, required
   filetype off                  " required

   " set the runtime path to include Vundle and initialize
   set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
   call vundle#begin()
   " alternatively, pass a path where Vundle should install plugins
   "call vundle#begin('~/some/path/here')

   " let Vundle manage Vundle, required
   Plugin 'VundleVim/Vundle.vim'

   " The following are examples of different formats supported.
   " Keep Plugin commands between vundle#begin/end.
   " plugin on GitHub repo
   Plugin 'tpope/vim-fugitive'
   " plugin from http://vim-scripts.org/vim/scripts.html
   Plugin 'L9'
   " Git plugin not hosted on GitHub
   Plugin 'git://git.wincent.com/command-t.git'
   " git repos on your local machine (i.e. when working on your own plugin)
   Plugin 'file:///home/gmarik/path/to/plugin'
   " The sparkup vim script is in a subdirectory of this repo called vim.
   " Pass the path to set the runtimepath properly.
   Plugin 'rstacruz/sparkup', {'rtp': 'vim/'}
   " Install L9 and avoid a Naming conflict if you've already installed a
   " different version somewhere else.
   Plugin 'ascenator/L9', {'name': 'newL9'}

   " All of your Plugins must be added before the following line
   call vundle#end()            " required
   filetype plugin indent on    " required
   " To ignore plugin indent changes, instead use:
   "filetype plugin on
   "
   " Brief help
   " :PluginList       - lists configured plugins
   " :PluginInstall    - installs plugins; append `!` to update or just :PluginUpdate
   " :PluginSearch foo - searches for foo; append `!` to refresh local cache
   " :PluginClean      - confirms removal of unused plugins; append `!` to auto-approve removal
   "
   " see :h vundle for more details or wiki for FAQ
   " Put your non-Plugin stuff after this line
   ```

4. Install Plugins:

   Launch `vim` and run `:PluginInstall`

   To install from command line: `vim +PluginInstall +qall`
